We have no punchlines for this one, it's just fucking terrifying.`,

      explanation: `In 2016, Scotland voted to remain in the EU. It turns out this didn't make a difference because if the United Kingdom DOES leave the EU, this will include Scotland. This has understandably left a lot of Scottish people frustrated. The SNP have promised to ensure Scotland's voice is heard in a 2020 Independence Referendum.`,
